        <h2>Chapter II: The Theft and Mrs. Joe Gargery</h2>

        <div class="paragraph">
            My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I, and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours on the representation that she had brought me up "by hand." Having at that time to find a meaning for every word I heard, I thought of a hand being applied to me in the way of flogging, and was much more likely to be right than I ever was about any other word in that place.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, always having a broom in her hand, and always sweeping and dusting. She was tall, bony, and hard, with a red face and a large apron that was always tied with a long, rusty string. Her commonest name among the neighbours was "Mrs. Joe," and her husband's name was "Joe."
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Joe Gargery, a mild, good-natured, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow, who was not in the least afraid of Mrs. Joe, because she was a woman, but was afraid of her because she was his wife, and had a terrible belief in her superior wisdom. He was a good-looking man, too, if his rough-shod nails and blacksmith's arms did not go against him.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            When I got home, my sister was very busy preparing the Christmas dinner. Mr. Pumblechook, the seedsman, and Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at the church, were coming, and Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, who kept a poor school. These were the only guests, besides Joe and me.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Mrs. Joe asked me where I had been. I replied, "Out on the marsh." "You'll go to the churchyard next, I suppose," said she. "Don't you be an ongrateful boy, or you'll be one of them as goes to the churchyard afore it's ready for 'em." I said I should not be ungrateful, and she said, "Don't you be a liar, or you'll be an ongrateful boy, too."
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I crept to bed at last, thinking about the convict, and resolved to do as he had told me. I thought that if he were caught, I might be dragged into trouble, and that if he escaped, it would be my doing.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I slept but little, and was up as soon as it was day. I stole a piece of bread and butter, half a pork pie, and a small bottle of brandy from the pantry. I also got the file out of Joe's tool-box.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I was much troubled by the brandy. It was a very small bottle, but it was too full to have been drunk by anybody, and its absence would be noticed. I poured some tar-water into the brandy bottle to make up the quantity, thinking that the convict would not notice the difference.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            When I got to the door, I found it locked. I remembered that Mrs. Joe always locked the doors at night. I went to the window, and after much difficulty, unfastened the latch.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I slipped out into the raw, damp morning, feeling like the wickedest creature under the sun, and started for the marshes with my pockets full of stolen goods. I knew I was doing a bad thing, but I felt I had no choice.
