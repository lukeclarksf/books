        <h2>Chapter III: The Two Fugitives</h2>

        <div class="paragraph">
            It was a miserably raw day, and the mist was heavy. I stole along, seeing nothing but the marshes, and hearing nothing but the wind, until I came near the battery.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I found the man shivering, and he fell upon the food like a dog. He ate the pork-pie, and the bread and butter, and drank the brandy, all in great haste. He then took the file and began to use it on his leg-iron, with his eyes rolling fearfully.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            “You young dog,” said he, with a grim smile, “what else is there?”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            “Only the mince-pie and the cheese, sir, and the brandy.”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            He started suddenly. “Hark! What was that?”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            We both listened. There was a faint sound of firing in the distance. The convict became intensely agitated. He finished filing, and his iron was loose.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            As he prepared to leave, I ventured to speak of the "young woman" he had threatened me with. He looked surprised and confused, as if he knew nothing of her. This puzzled me greatly.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Then, as I hurried away, I saw another convict, a man with a badly bruised face and a broad-brimmed hat, crouching down in a ditch. He seemed to recognize me and started at the sight of me, but then disappeared.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I fled home, completely exhausted. I told myself I was safe, yet I was more guilty than ever, having served two escaped criminals instead of one.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Just as I reached the door, I heard the sound of footsteps and voices. A party of soldiers, marching with muskets, stopped at the forge. An officer asked Joe if he was the blacksmith.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Joe, surprised, said he was. The officer then asked Joe to mend a broken pair of handcuffs for them. It was Christmas morning.
