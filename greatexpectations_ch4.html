        <h2>Chapter IV: Christmas Day and the Missing Pie</h2>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The soldiers, after Joe mended their handcuffs, departed. We proceeded to the annual Christmas dinner, where the usual guests were assembled: Mr. Wopsle, the parish clerk; Uncle Pumblechook, a well-to-do corn-chandler; and Mr. and Mrs. Hubble.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The whole dinner was a prolonged torment for me. The guests constantly lectured me on the wickedness of youth and the duty of gratitude to my sister, which only amplified my guilt over the theft.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Uncle Pumblechook, in particular, repeatedly stressed how indebted I was to my sister for raising me "by hand." Every comment felt like a direct accusation.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            As the conversation became more severe, I thought of running away from the table, but the stern eye of my sister prevented me. I tried to relieve my distress by drinking a large quantity of the "savory" brandy I had replaced with tar-water.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Finally, the centerpiece of the dinner—the pork-pie—was brought out. Mrs. Joe announced proudly how she had protected it, and how she hoped I was grateful for such a rare treat.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I knew the pie was gone. My guilt reached a breaking point. I started crying and was about to confess everything when Mrs. Joe, turning to the table, declared, "Now, here's the pie!"
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            She then discovered the pie was missing. Before the alarm could truly erupt, there came a tremendous **BANG** at the door, and the whole company started. We all cried out, "The police!"
