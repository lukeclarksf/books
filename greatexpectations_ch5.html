        <h2>Chapter V: The Search and the Recapture</h2>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The **BANG** at the door that interrupted Mrs. Joe's discovery of the missing pie was not the police, but a party of soldiers, led by the sergeant whose handcuffs Joe had mended. They had come to ask Joe to accompany them with his gun and forge skills to help secure the convicts.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Joe, despite his gentle nature, was thrilled and immediately agreed. The whole Christmas party followed the soldiers into the misty marshes. I was in a terrible state, terrified that the convict would accuse me of stealing the food and the file.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The soldiers and the villagers searched for a long time, hearing whistles and cries across the desolate landscape. Finally, they came upon the two convicts—the one I had helped (Magwitch) and the bruised one I had seen in the ditch—locked in a violent struggle.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            They were fighting furiously, mutually accusing each other of trying to murder the other. The soldiers subdued them, separating them violently.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            My convict, Magwitch, looked at me, and I shook my head slightly, silently begging him not to betray me. He then made a surprising declaration to the officer.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            "I took some wittles, sir, up at the blacksmith's. I stole a piece of pie and some brandy. And I stole a file to get off my leg-iron. I did it, and no one else."
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            This confession, which was completely true except that it omitted my role, was meant to clear me. I felt a surge of loyalty toward him, even as he was being marched away back to the hulks.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The two convicts were taken to a boat on the river. As the soldiers rowed them away, the fighting convict (Compeyson) remained cold and hard, while my convict, Magwitch, gave me a sorrowful look.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The entire Christmas party returned, thrilled by the morning’s excitement, and utterly ignorant of my terrible secret.
