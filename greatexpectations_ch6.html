        <h1>Great Expectations</h1>
        <h2>Chapter VI: Conscience and the Unspoken Truth</h2>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The capture of the convicts became the central story of the village for weeks. Everyone praised Joe for his assistance, and Mrs. Joe loudly bemoaned the loss of her pork-pie, which she now believed the captured convict had stolen.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I was consumed by my secret. The fact that the convict had confessed to my crime, thus shielding me, intensified my feeling of guilt and fear. I realized my connection to this criminal was a burden I could never share.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Joe, in his simple, good-natured way, observed me and tried to cheer me up. He talked about the strange convict's confession, marveling at how a man, even a bad one, could confess to a crime. He never suspected my involvement.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            There was a moment when I almost confessed to Joe. His kindness and gentle nature drew the truth nearly out of me. But the fear of disappointing him, and the fear that he would no longer be my friend, choked the words. I kept silent.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I was particularly struck by the convict's self-sacrifice. He could have easily implicated me to gain some sympathy, but he chose to protect the little boy who had helped him. This act complicated my moral view of him.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The missing pork-pie was often mentioned, and my sister would often bring it up to shame me into gratitude. I lived under a perpetual cloud of worry, convinced that someone, somehow, knew the truth.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            My conscience was worse than my fear of the law. It became clear to me that I had a terrible secret to keep, and that this secret would set me apart from the simple, good life of the forge forever.
