        <h1>Great Expectations</h1>
        <h2>Chapter I: Introduction and the Convict</h2>

        <div class="paragraph">
            My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister,—Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like, were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the tombstone of his wife, my mother, I drew the notion that she was a freckled woman with a sickly face, and that to want to marry her and to be married to her was a great deal more than I should ever have thought of. The five little stone tablets, each about a foot and a half long, which were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle—gave me the idea that life was all a blunder, and that there was nothing to be done but to come back and try all over again.

        <div class="paragraph">
            I am a village boy, and I was at the village churchyard. The village lay on the flat, dreary, water-side country, some twenty miles from the sea, and some miles down the river. The river was tidal and full of mud. The marshes were just in front of the church, and the churchyard was all flat, and was cut up into mounds, where the dead lay, and where the living walked. The river was a tidal river, and the land was low and muddy, and the tide was out.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The day was beginning to be dark, and the low church was a little more indistinct than the great flat wilderness of low-lying marshes and low-lying sea. There was a low, heavy sky, a low, heavy fog, and a low, heavy sound of the distant sea. The flat country and the low, heavy sky, seemed to be all in a tremble. The great flat wilderness was cut up by dykes and mounds; it was a dreary place, a place of ditches and rank grass, and of the only thing that broke the level of the flat land—the long, straight, black, and ominous line of the gibbet.

        <div class="paragraph">
            At such a time, and in such a place, I am telling you that I am quite alone, and I am quite alone.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            “Hold your noise!” cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch. “Keep still, you little devil, or I’ll cut your throat!”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            “Oh! Don't cut my throat, sir,” I pleaded, in terror. “Pray don't do it, sir.”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            “Tell us your name!” said the man. “Quick!”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            “Pip, sir.”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            “Once more,” said the man, staring at me. “Give it mouth!”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            “Pip, sir.”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            “Show us where you live,” said the man. “Pint out the place!”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in the distance.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            “I took you for a booby, didn’t I?” said the man, looking at me with a most dreadful air. “Well, I'll take you for another—for a cunning one. You bring me to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You bring the lot to me, at that old battery over yonder. Say no word of it, bring the lot, and you shall live. Say a word of it, and your heart and liver shall be cut out, and I'll bring 'em to you, and they'll be cooked and eaten! Now, what do you say?”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I could do nothing but answer, “Yes, sir.”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            “Blesh you, now!” said the man. “You do it, and you shall have me for your friend. Don't you do it, and you shall have me for your enemy. I ain't alone, mind you. There's a young woman hid with me, as has been my companion, and she'd tear you limb from limb if she was let loose on you. She's a very wicked young woman, she is. She'd be as sharp as a razor, and as wicked as a devil. Now, look here. I'm going to turn you upside down, and let you go. You'll soon see your home. Be off!”
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            With that, he turned me upside down, and emptied my pockets. Then he set me down, and I ran home as fast as I could lay my legs to the ground.
